Hardware Description languages execute the program exactly how a hardware would have reacted to it. In hardware there are multiple parts of circuit operate in the parallel while in the programming languages the execution takes place in the sequential order.
The HDLs also have the concept time and propagation delays because hardware 
operates with precise timing constraints. In case of programming languages the 
processor is all the timing delays are handles by the processor design

Bluespec SystemVerilog (BSV) introduces high-level constructs and strong typing, making it more modular, maintainable, and less error-prone than traditional Verilog:
BluespecSV would be preffered for these project as

It makes development faster and cleaner. BSV’s high-level features and strong typing help avoid a lot of the common bugs and headaches you might run into with traditional Verilog.

Its rule-based approach lets you describe hardware behavior in a more intuitive way, making it easier to reason about what’s actually happening at each step.

It expresses hardware intent more clearly. With BSV, you’re less likely to accidentally create unintended behaviors — something that’s a lot easier to mess up in Verilog.

Maintaining and scaling the design is simpler. Thanks to its modular structure and built-in type safety, you can build larger designs without things getting messy.


When we run HDL code it simulates the actual digital circuits on which our code 
runs while in case programming languages it runs on the existing processors

Most of the hardware system and buses operates at the 8 bit system. 
Pros is that it can help us for the scalability of the operation but its wasting lots of 
space

The XOR-fold hash is simple but not cryptographically secure. Its main limitations: Thats many input string are possible to have the same hash.
A ^ B ^ C = B ^ C ^ A = C ^ A ^ B
